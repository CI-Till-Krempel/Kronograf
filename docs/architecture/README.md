# Architecture Documentation

Use this section to capture architecture decisions, diagrams, and design notes.

Key practices
- Record significant decisions as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Keep diagrams versioned (PlantUML, Mermaid, or exported images with source)
- Link ADRs to stories and requirements

Templates
- TEMPLATE-ADR.md — Use this to document each decision with context, options, and consequences.
